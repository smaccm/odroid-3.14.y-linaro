menuconfig POWER_ASV
	bool "Adaptive Supply Voltage (ASV) support"
	help
	  ASV is a technique used on Samsung SoCs which provides the
	  recommended supply voltage for some specific parts(like CPU, MIF, etc)
	  that support DVFS. For a given operating frequency, the voltage is
	  recommended based on SoCs ASV group. ASV group info is provided in the
	  chip id info which depends on the chip manufacturing process.

	  Say Y here to enable Adaptive Supply Voltage support.

config POWER_EXYNOS_ASV
	bool "Adaptive Supply Voltage for Exynos"
	help
	  Exynos supports ASV depending upon the ASV group fused on chip.
	  Users can request ASV specific to a frequency for a particular member
	  from corresponding DVFS driver.

	  Say Y here to enable Exynos Adaptive Supply Voltage.
